# Hello-World
My first project

This is de first day of the 100 day coding challenge. Today I am setting upe everything.
There is a big gap between learning the fundamentals of javascript and actually working with javascript. 
By getting experience with projects and building a portfolio I hope to be great at programming and land a good job.
I hope you will join me in my adventures
